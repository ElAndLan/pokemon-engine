# ENGINE_RUNTIME_SPEC

Status: **Implemented baseline plus Phase 16 package contracts authorized.** Headless runtime helpers are written
and tested (`FixedStepClock`, virtual resolution, camera, input state, scene stack, raw-folder
`GameDb`, battle action menu, battle event presenter, exported config/pack boot, Runtime
`--smoke`). The Silk.NET host loads exported `config.json`/`game.cgmpack` and renders a playable
showcase battle with GL clear/scissor rectangles plus a tiny built-in bitmap text drawer. Full
sprite-batch renderer, asset-backed sprites, reusable UI kit, audio, and dev-mode project loading
in the host are **not** implemented.

## Purpose
The engine contract: loop timing, renderer boundary, virtual resolution, input mapping, scene
stack, UI kit primitives, audio, dev-mode data loading, and debug tooling.

## Must lock
- Fixed 60 Hz sim + interpolated render (ADR-005); accumulator clamp (already in FixedStepClock).
- `IRenderer` surface (sprite batch, tilemap chunks, UI quads/text) — game code never sees GL.
- Virtual resolution + integer-scale/letterbox rules; camera clamp; input action map + rebinding.
- UI kit v1 primitives (9-slice, bitmap font, typewriter, cursor, HP bar); scene stack semantics.

## Built, pure & tested (Phase 6 — `Cgm.Runtime.Engine`)
- **Loop**: `FixedStepClock` (Core, Phase 1) — 60 Hz accumulator, 5-tick clamp.
- **Virtual resolution**: `VirtualResolution.Fit(window, virtual) → Viewport` — integer scale,
  centered, letterboxed; scale clamped ≥1.
- **Camera**: `Camera.Clamp(target, view, map)` — centers on target, clamps to map edges, centers
  a map smaller than the view. World coord at the viewport top-left, in pixels.
- **Input**: `GameAction` enum + `InputState` — edge-detected IsDown/WasPressed/WasReleased; the
  platform source feeds `Update(heldNow)`, the sim reads queries (replayable).
- **Scene stack**: `SceneStack<T>` — push/pop/replace/active; only the top scene is active.
- **Data**: dev-mode `GameDb` = `ProjectLoader.Load(folder)` (Core, Phase 2).
- **Battle action presentation**: `BattleScene` builds a player action menu from Core legality,
  including moves, eligible `ActivateForm(formId, moveIndex)` actions, and legal party switches.
  It submits selected actions to `BattleController`, presents `BattleEvent`s through
  `BattleEventPresenter`, and exposes a render snapshot of active creatures, party HP, menu state,
  recent log lines, and outcome.
- **Exported boot/smoke**: `ExportedGameBoot` reads exported `config.json`, verifies the pack
  manifest/runtime version/content hash, loads the configured start map, initializes the showcase
  battle, and smoke-submits one legal action.
- **Window wiring**: `RuntimeHost` still owns the Silk.NET loop and Esc-to-close behavior. When an
  exported config exists beside the executable, it uses the exported window title/resolution, maps
  Up/Down/Confirm keyboard state into `InputState`, updates the showcase battle, and draws a
  readable battle screen with clear/scissor rectangles and built-in bitmap text.

## Phase 16 specification completion contract

`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` v4 §6 is the user-authorized contract for 16A-16G. Before each package edits
code, expand this spec with its named lock: boot/error/data ownership; fixed-step/renderer; scene/UI/
input; overworld; player/save/audio; battle presentation; or verification. Use the exact defaults,
ordering, budgets, exit codes, and acceptance rows in §6. No additional confirmation is required.
An unresolved rule that §6 does not cover follows v4 §2.1; the old short outline is not a blocker or
permission to invent a second Runtime architecture.
